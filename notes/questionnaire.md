TITLE: A questionnaire regarding Bioinformatics Workflow Systems 
Hello,

In [my department](https://www.ics.forth.gr/cbml/) we have just started a new project called [OpenBio-C](https://www.openbio.eu/) which aims to develop a new collaborative Tool repository and Workflow Management System for the bioinformatics community.

In order to steer the development towards the right objectives, we have compiled a questionnaire to help us assess the main obstacles that impede collaboration and reproducibility. 

The questionnaire that should take no more than 10 minutes of your time is available here:

Please feel free to circulate this post to any of your peers that is involved in bioinformatics research.

Thank you for your time and your valuable feedback! If you have any questions or additional feedback you are welcome to PM me or send an email to [kantale@ics.forth.gr](mailto:kantale@ics.forth.gr).

TITLE: A questionnaire on workflow management systems and reproducibility in bioinformatics 
Hello everyone!

[URL="https://www.openbio.eu/"]OpenBio-C[/URL] is a new research initiative funded by the Greek General Secretariat of Research and Technology which aims to develop a new collaborative Tool repository and Workflow Management System mainly for the bioinformatics community.

Part of our development effort is to assess the needs of the community and record the main obstacles that impede the collaboration among researchers and the reproducibility of analysis.

Towards this aim, we have compiled a questionnaire that will give us insights in order to steer the development towards the right objectives. The questionnaire that should take no more than 10 minutes of your time is available here:
